    <p>
      I feel so sad since Thursday. It&#39;s confusing what has happened. I
      didn&#39;t realise you were counting on me this way. In a way I felt that
      I was just helping out, like me leaving would be a bit annoying
      practically but in the end wouldn&#39;t change so much. I didn&#39;t
      realise I was important to you. You should have told me. But also now I
      see that you did, in your own way. I just didn&#39;t catch it quick
      enough. (Verbality can be real helpful at times.)<br />
      I am filled now with this strange feeling where I was just sure about
      wanting one thing and now I want the exact opposite. (how fucking Pieces
      of me) <br />
      I want to say &#39;I&#39;m sorry&#39; and I want to say &#39;forgive
      me&#39;; I want to say all the words that draw a pleading as an attempt to
      reverse the course of our shared experience which cannot be done.<br />
      So instead I&#39;m saying;let&#39;s talk about it.&#39;
