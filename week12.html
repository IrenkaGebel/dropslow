      dragging externality. hide hide hide! I grew up in Warsaw. I refuse the
      idea of headphones. I have five toes in my left foot and I have five other
      toes in my left foot. I once scratched Ire&#39;s leg with my long toenail
      called Pazur. And that&#39;s why everyone calls me Pazur. I became
      vegetarian when I was 23. My mom is on a beach. It&#39;s good for today. I
      will continue tomorrow. Don&#39;t look at this message. When are we gonna
      paint portraits?

      Dużo pierdów i czekania, aż skończysz gadać. Coś wycieka lub coś
      wyssysasz, nie jestem pewny które. Czuję twoją samotność i panikę. Czuję,
      że w słowach się nie da, że potrzebuje kurwa czegoś innego, bomby jakiejś
      lub

      (basically all I see when I walk the streets of a city is cash) You know
      I&#39;ve been thinking about jobs again, jobs in the city, this still new
      city. I&#39;ve been trying to thread different needles, unsure of myself,
      unsure of the future. I kept on finding annoying reasons to be upset with
      the City, as a place where you can only either consume or produce. I feel
      continuously unequipped to live in a City. I get confused about how to
      navigate it, how to walk into place with confidence or at leats a sense of
      belonging. My self in flux either walks a performance down the road or
      puts on a hoodie, feeling grateful for the anonymity of supermarkets and
      hiding in the shades of trees. I think this is all tided to my childhood,
      growing up on the border between a city and a suburb, paired with the lack
      of social life of my parents: never seeing them have friends, never really
      playing with other kids (there are stories that I did but that was too
      young for me to really remember.) The mission of my family&#39;s live was
      to stay isolated because confronting others meant confronting my mother
      confronting others and you never knew how that would go. Things changed a
      little bit when I went to middle school and had 3 hours to kill between
      school and ballet. I was shy but I often had a friend by my side who went
      to the same school so we&#39;d walk around or sit in a cafe and study. We
      ate Subway or pretzels or nothing at all. I got to know some streets but
      still I felt like a stranger to this town, always having to come back to
      the outside, to this border place of home. The first time it clicked for
      me that city people are a species in themselves is when I met a
      New-Yorker. Gosh, what an annoying type. Don&#39;t get me wrong, not all
      city-people are annoying but this affiliation correlates with a sense of
      pride that&#39;s often hard for me to bite through. It&#39;s like
      they&#39;re saying &#39;I have a right to be here&#39; which is fairly
      reasonable if you haven&#39;t felt out of place your whole life. But
      weren&#39;t cities supposed to be the safe heaven&#39;s for outcasts and
      misfits? I&#39;m starting to feel like it was a myth started by social
      butterflies who happened to live at a time when rent didn&#39;t restrain
      your mobility to this extend. Anyways, in these recent days I&#39;ve been
      specifically focusing on places where food and drink is served in cities.
      So yes, they&#39;re places where one either exchanges capital for
      nourishment or, if you&#39;re on the other side, gains capital through the
      timed act of serving others. My observation is that whenever I&#39;m on
      the former side, I feel a sense of discomfort. It can vary from slight to
      overwhelming, but no matter what I do, I think &#39;I don&#39;t belong
      here, why do I need a waiter to serve me food?&#39; Despite this strong
      reaction I never felt inclined to try the other side, to work in a
      kitchen. I was afraid of the back pain and I was suspicious it would kill
      my joy for cooking and serving. There was also for sure a little bit of my
      parents voice in it which kept on repeating they didn&#39;t pay for my
      education for me to work in a kitchen. But seeing Trang last week shifted
      something inside of my. For the first time I tried to image what it would
      be like to get excited about kitchens around town with an appreciation of
      their craft, knowing the ins and outs of it. What would it be like to be
      an insider? Not a chef, an apprentice to the art of cooking which I always
      held in high regard yet which, like every industry in this post-capitalist
      junk yard, screams hierarchy and whiteness. There is this image of a young
      couple, with a child or a dog, queer or not, who sips on orange wine and
      snacks on bites of sourdough bread and cheese that keeps flashing in my
      head. It&#39;s in equal parts an instagram image (how much do we invest in
      making the image a reality for ourselves?) and a weekend City image, one
      encountered on streets where the price of coffee begins at 4 euros.
      It&#39;s weird because it&#39;s like a statistical image of myself in the
      next 10 years. Isn&#39;t it? I can&#39;t stop thinking about class and
      race and how my choices fit into what I&#39;m granted to have choice in.
      What&#39;s wrong with the image? The fact that it&#39;s an image? The fact
      that those people are being served? They might have been serving at some
      point of their lives. Or one may ask: What stops me from enjoying a glass
      of orange wine in the company of my friends on a Saturday afternoon? And I
      may answer: inner angst, narrow budgets, war, living in a foreign country,
      the nihilism of capitalist reality, people looking.

      (I want to feel accessorised.) <br />
      Ciało przesuwa się poza nią. Wchodzi do dziur, ale tylko tam gdzie nikt
      nie patrzy. Każdy oddech wydaje się być podniesieniem worku ziemniaków.
      Chodzą jej po głowie zgarbione lecz giętkie starsze osoby żyjące pod wodą,
      które przed chwilą odwiedziła w śnie. Noc zawsze przynosi więcej kolorów
      niż dzień.

      (hey who&#39;s knocking? już nie pamiętam początku. nie zapomnij o ryżu!)
      I&#39;m standing in the metro next to someone reading
      &#39;Technofeudalism&#39; by Yanis. The cover&#39;s flashy green and I
      realise it&#39;s the first time I&#39;m seeing the book in flesh. I know
      they&#39;re putting effort in making this book appeal to the masses so I
      should forget the sleeve but deep inside I&#39;m wishing for a different
      design. I&#39;m sure the person standing next to me would have some good
      ideas. I&#39;m having a morning-friend-crush. This person is sitting by
      the window, in one of those 4 seat compartments characteristic to lines 2
      and 6 in Brussels. We&#39;d have crossed one stop when his company changes
      and I see him nod slightly towards his new travel companions. It&#39;s a
      gesture I&#39;ve never seen anyone do in the metro. I&#39;m starting to
      suspect he&#39;s a communist. Or at leats an anarchist living with
      communist nostalgia. Next to him sit two young kids, dressed in martial
      arts uniforms and they caretaker, a stunning woman with carved features
      and strong, wavy black hair. The hair falls on her face often which makes
      me notice her habit of flopping it from one side to another. They&#39;re a
      jolly group. It&#39;s clear they&#39;re enjoying each other&#39;s company.
      They&#39;re chatting and the kids make the woman laugh a lot. They&#39;re
      a crew. I stare at them for too long. I wonder what the anarchist feels
      right now. Is he curious? Or indifferent? I want to follow him. And I kind
      of do. But that&#39;s because walking the same direction until I need to
      catch a train and I see him walking down a populated, perpendicular road.
      Farewell metro friend. I hope you&#39;ll have a good day.

      Lato wypala każdy potencjał. Pomysły wyparowują zanim zdążysz je złapać.
      Ludzi przybywa. Wszystko zwalnia, ale też staje się płytkie jakby żadna
      głębia nie dawała rady ze słońcem. Promienie muskają nasze wrażliwe ciała,
      a skórka wysycha. Przynoszę ci krem nawilżający po tym jak zapomniałam
      tego z spf-em na plaże. Byliśmy pocałowani, ale delikatnie. Staram sobie
      wyobrazić 10 stopni więcej i słabo mi się robi. Kark nagrzany, lawiruje
      między potencjałem wyjścia i wejścia. Chyba wytopiłam coś po drodze, ale
      jeszcze nie znam tej nowoujawnionej warstwy. Kino mnie złości ostatnio.
      Reżyserowane obrazy nie dają rady z rzeczywistością, która jest albo
      pochłaniającą fantazją, albo śmierdzącym terrorem. Nie ma niczego
      pomiędzy. Chociaż nie, jest. Jest nuda. Ten dziwny stan, w którym
      większość z nas zdaje się trwać. Z nudy przeskakujemy na tempo, z tempa w
      nudę. Tempo działa jak rozproszenie potrzeb. Centrum handlowe jest
      najlepszą tego stanu metaforą. Jak nie, to wszyscy patrzymy w dół.

      Brakuje mi babci. Brakuje mi mamy. Brakuje mi ludzi, którzy swoje
      przeżyli, którzy trzymają w sobie stoickie kamienie zaczepienia, którzy
      mają punkt odniesienia. Wszystko dookoła lata.<br />Brakuje kogoś, kto
      powie mi, że wystarczy żebym była sobą. Że nie muszę się martwić.
