      This week I filled up 10 pages of my sketchbook. Truth be told Apichatpong
      occupies like 4 out of these yet it has been deep feeding time
      nevertheless. Thank you moon for broadening my pupils and bringing my way
      many hearty souls. The week was topped off with a lengthy conversation
      with R. about growing. We&#39;re trying to put together and application
      for a.pass and we spoke navigating the methods of artistic research
      we&#39;re already practicing. Some of the thing that were mentioned
      include: learning from manual processes, translating for each other,
      reading (out loud), scanning, conversation as changing your mind and
      singing while biking. The latter surprised me the most but that&#39;s just
      because I haven&#39;t been biking the last two years so I feel
      disconnected. It&#39;s a car free day in Brukselka. Instead of honking I
      hear skaters skating up and down my window street. I&#39;m drinking coffee
      and thinking about this week&#39;s meals. I think I&#39;m gonna go for
      some baked root vegetables with bulgur and a lentil dal later on. The
      sunny days are leaving us and we ought to warm up our bodies from the
      inside. I shouldn&#39;t lose the strong currents, I need to continue
      surrendering to them, they will lead, I don&#39;t have to lead. How to be
      motivated on my own—I already know. Don&#39;t look in the exterior. Make
      offerings, give away. Listen. Engage in what expands you.

      We could be touching right now yet we&#39;re standing away, away from
      ourselves. The sound is filling my lungs but I&#39;m not screaming, I will
      not be screaming tonight. He laughs at their glasses in discomfort and
      spills his drink. The day filled up nicely with grains of activities, all
      non-sensical, all there to just take up space. I wish some would take up
      more space than others. I wish our chances were greater than what seems to
      be a very lonely time. We&#39;re just very fucking entangled and I&#39;m
      standing in this noisy bar, thinking that these people remember the past
      but they cannot take me back. Muddy days.

      Idę najbardziej śmieciową ulicą w mieście - otaczają mnie stosy ubrań,
      kosmetyków i zbędnych obiektów do postawienia sobie (gdzieś) - wszystkie
      przyjechały z odległych zakątków naszej planety, aby przemienić się w
      złoto w kieszeni kilku osób z innych odległych zakątków. Idąc tą ulicą
      czuję nieskończoną ilość historii, które nakładają się na to miejsce,
      nieskończoną ilość wymiarów i żyć, to wszystko poprzekładane potem i
      tłuszczem. W takich miejscach nie wiatru. Nie ma go w pokojach ludzi
      szyjących koszulki, nie ma go w pokojach ludzi kupujących koszulki. Idąc
      tą ulicą czuje się gęstość procesów, w których jesteśmy zaplątani.

      Im scrolling through my screenshots, reaching as far as maybe two years? I
      find very similar patterns of interests, something at the crossroads
      between the role and meaning of the Internet and the spiritual dimension
      of how to deal with planetary and ethical criseses. Im sort of surprised
      the thread is this consistent. There is of course some notions of
      trans-forming and re-creating identities or forms of representation but
      there the interest is more visual or aesthetic. It could be interesting to
      write about how the two (the visual and the intellectual) complement as
      I&#39;m usually quite judgemental of those aesthetic desires, perhaps
      because I can&#39;t &#39;understand&#39; them but now scrolling through I
      also notice I simply don&#39;t act on them much. The occasional image of
      myself that passes through is somewhat disappointing. Most of the time I
      feel what I always feel looking at photos of my younger self:
      disassociation. I think its because I see someone who&#39;s afraid, or
      reduced to a safer version of themselves. also someone conflicted about
      the phone mirror. I think I mostly use the phone as a window that allows
      me to see into something else or somewhere else, very rarely do I turn it
      towards myself. It still amazes me that people document themselves all the
      time. Just today I saw someone walking and watching a video of themselves
      on their phone, one made for some social media. Who are those phone-selves
      for everyone? Is it vanity or security? Or is it sociality?

      Ive been thinking about radicalisation, especially in the shape of action.
      Its a standard strand of thought that strides by when I end up on the
      plane - my insides twist and all I can think about is how my whole being
      is against the action Im performing yet I&#39;m still performing it. The
      only thing I can cling onto is social research - the whole ordeal of
      arriving, walking through, undressing, unpacking, being touched, drinking
      over-prized machine coffee, standing in toilet queues and then getting
      into a can that reaches the speed beyond our comprehension makes for a
      pristine observatory spot. But yeah what crossed my mind earlier today was
      this notion of showing active disagreement. I realised I really disagree
      with the essential definition of children, teens, adults and elderly that
      European policies are build upon. It&#39;d be nice to look into those
      definition and find ways of acting against them. I was thinking of Ros
      working with elderly women or the joy of speaking to Gucio. I want to
      dismantle the stages of &#39;usability&#39; or when should someone do
      what. Whenever I get triggered to think I need to prove useful to the
      society I inhabit, I should be reminded of the opposition towards the
      governance of said society. Just how to express that in a way when Im not
      elevating myself beyond others, where Im working from within a side
      tunnel, carving a different way? ps. i really need to get a new pair of
      glasses

      Walking back from V., singing about Virgin Mary because I see her at every
      corner around here. In the song I ask her to forgive me for not protecting
      her from God raping her and forcing her to give birth to Jesus. I said I
      was too young to speak so I couldn&#39;t do much. But I still carry shame
      in me, I feel her judgement. But the song was good, maybe I&#39;ll leave
      the island cloaked in forgiveness. We talked about war and drugs. Earlier
      I followed the thought path of &#39;if you&#39;re critical of this
      reality, how would yours look like&#39;? Like what would my ideal
      context/community/place look like? Matter is a negotiation and I don&#39;t
      subscribe to (I am critical of) those kinds of practices of totalising
      vision but it still felt worth while to think through tweaks like: how are
      children treated and who raised them? How do humans commute? How does the
      urban look like? What is the educational path of a lifetime? How does
      difference look like? What is ritualistic, what is regular, what is
      chaotic? Here I see that all it takes is to be present.
