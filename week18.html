      Getting itchy. Gotta leave the house in 3 minutes. Read Memorial in 3
      days, flew (blah) and so I&#39;m entirely split into 3. Recently I
      appreciate: sleeping in cool bedrooms, fiction, full (cotton) underwear
      meaning not thongs, sparkling water, photography, babies, talking walks in
      the city and observing city life, library browsing. Wind is blowing change
      and my three minutes are up.

      Itchy Monday morning eyes, the impossibility of it all. Broke a plate,
      kick things off at 10 only, could/will mornings get easier? List of things
      to get for the studio: tea-towels coffee, coffee-container

      When can you see yourself clearly? This week I&#39;ve been confronting a
      lot of myself, especially the stories of who I am that in action dissolve
      into the contrary. One part is really about how little I actually value my
      skills or labour, how the decisions I make are often based on the fact
      that I&#39;m just not good enough at something. I begin and quickly I
      convince myself the way I&#39;m doing it is lesser, cull. I convinced
      myself that with the privilege I have, I can afford to work for free, that
      all experience matters. But it&#39;s all tangled up in shame and lack of
      self-confidence. I trick myself, I implode my dreams, and continue
      narrowing down the space I take up in the world. I&#39;m starting my life
      for the third fucking time. I burn all bridges behind me, I chop off
      fingers, tongues and poke my eyes out thinking I&#39;m just being fair and
      that others matter but shit it&#39;s really a mechanism that helps me stay
      my paralysed self. I feel socially inapt. I&#39;ve been noticing it more
      and more since we have a studio and it&#39;s so natural for eda to walk up
      to people, to have small chats, and I&#39;m just uncomfortable because
      it&#39;s all short conversation that I don&#39;t know how to do. So I shut
      myself off and think &#39;these guys are not like me.&#39; It&#39;s like I
      made a mechanism out of not-belonging that keeps in place this small sense
      of worth I have but why? What am I afraid of? Hurting others? Admitting to
      a mistake? Or is it about the status of abnormality, the wanting to be
      different? Or is it the primal disappointment, fuck is it about the
      parents? I really hope it&#39;s not that but it does check out. I cross
      most humanity out because my folks couldn&#39;t treat me like an
      interesting human or I just have a hard time getting along with them and
      that just projects onto everyone else - it&#39;s impossible to know me (or
      s I think) because I&#39;m the middle kid who always slipped away, was
      always out of focus. This is such a loop, I&#39;m gonna need some help to
      get out of this. I think asking for help is a good place to start. I&#39;m
      so deep in my own shit, filled with regret to the brim. I&#39;m head is
      like a scanner of all the what ifs and should haves and it&#39;s been
      scanning for days and all I feel is this deep disappointment, like, I will
      not believe any words of consolidation because all I see is that I stifled
      myself all the way through and it&#39;s just one of those moments where I
      want a diagnosis for something which is a terrible thing to think about
      but I have that I can perform full-functioning so well, wear this mask
      while actually I&#39;m just really really scared.

      I think I&#39;m not calling my parents because I&#39;m ashamed of not
      doing good, delivering good news, not excelling with a pay check and the
      ultimate freedom of being able to buy myself shit. At times I wish I could
      move on from them, let them be part of a past, like a friend you break up
      with or simply fade away. I hate the power they have over me, the person
      they bring out whenever I&#39;m with them. &#39;That&#39;s not me&#39; I
      try to say to myself but there I am again.
