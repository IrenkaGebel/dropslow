      The swimming corridor was maybe 5 meters wide but I couldn&#39;t see
      it&#39;s end. The ground was wavy and all was made out of a stone that
      looked somewhere between sand stone and marble. Before getting in I
      didn&#39;t see the animals. The water itself was wavy to and I got carried
      away pretty quickly but I also knew I could swim back. Was I fast and
      clever enough to not to run into a shark that was floating just next to
      me? Or the tiger whose fur shone as if water was where he always belonged.
      I was both terrified and relaxed which is a good way of describing this
      whole story. There were lesbians from Girls Like Us and some vacation
      house which turned out to be too small for everyone to use and ot
      expensive to keep. I couldn&#39;t see the issue, to me it felt that those
      people are jus complaining, they always pointed to the (often potential)
      problems around. I was immersed in sandy colors, winds and waters which in
      and of itself was enough to relax my whole being. I like how in dreams you
      always just end up in places, the commute is rarely included unless
      it&#39;s in itself central to the experience. Daily life is made up of
      commutes. Our flesh, the heaviness of our bodies is what we&#39;ve got to
      work with everyday. No wonder people sit so much. All those limbs, the
      tissue, the water. I wonder what it would be like to have a technology
      that temporarily drains you of water so that you can travel more light and
      you get refilled upon arrival. For a substance that makes most of us and
      most of everything on planet earth, our water technologies are extremely
      poor. Everyone is so enthralled and in awe of large language models and
      I&#39;m just like &#39;meh&#39;, it&#39;s not that advanced really. I
      think because everything looks so sleek and it&#39;s all about clicking
      buttons, everyone lives the illusion of the future is the now but it&#39;s
      all just the looks of it. We know how to package things, how to
      aestetisise experience. In my view it&#39;s really the connectedness of
      the internet and the human participation in the making of its cultures
      that make up the most wicked, exciting things of the century. It&#39;s
      just so terribly misuses, wasted really. Just like water.

      Just not cutting it. Again. In the same numbers as two years ago. I&#39;m
      trying to be here but I&#39;m not often. There is song in the past of your
      own head. Maybe there will be water tomorrow, bast water. Maybe there will
      be vast water next week. Homes are so alive. Their chemistry continues to
      permeate my own. It&#39;s ours. I&#39;m swimming quite deep under the
      water.

      Life is so rich but then I&#39;m standing in a queue to buy cheap
      underwear and the woman in front of me buys a basket of candy and plastic
      for 85 euros and I look to the side at a poster that prices a conversation
      between a client and a customer at 00,00 euros. I sigh and turn the wrong
      way, by instinct, take the bus and then regret taking the bus, going this
      way after all. I&#39;m growing to feel stuck. I know and I don&#39;t know.
      I&#39;m not young, but I&#39;m not old. I have all the time, but I&#39;m
      running out of time. I&#39;m placed in places, in passing or in context,
      there is no old stuff, only new, no grounding, just chains. Gasping for
      air. Not answering. Not being good at answering, taking initiative,
      deciding, capital management, being normal, not being normal, doing what
      is asked of me and then taking off to the sideway because there&#39;s some
      smells of meadow there and pine trees. Who can ever know tomorrow when I
      wish I could do something to change the way you look at this situation.
