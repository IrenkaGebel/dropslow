      Angry, bitting, upset at the you that stuck around. This mode is specific,
      it&#39;s like entrapment but forever in the moment, the memory begins to
      fade and it&#39;s out, I&#39;m out of my mind. Nothing valuable can crawl
      out of me, I regret my past choices, I wish not to drown in regret. I need
      money to move, I need to move to make money. Stillness catapults me into
      nothingness. What friend I&#39;d made, what lovers left behind, this tale
      could be different, try one more time. No bullshit this time.

      Expanding horizons that is seeing across the broader water&#39;s. Reading
      Dionne Brand travel, making piece with company, reading Dionne Brand:
    </p>
    <p>
      What holds poetry together in this city, what holds me together, is the
      knowldge that I cannot resist seeing; what holds me is the real look of
      things. If I see someone I see the ghost of them, the air around them, and
      where they&#39;ve been. If I see the city I see its living ghostliness —
      the stray looks, the dying hands. I see its needs and its discomforts
      locked in apartment, its time that no one has — the growing citizenry of
      homelessness — (...) The middle of the city, where what looks like an
      ordinary life is composed of what is beaten into or calculated and chalked
      up to the world. What is accepted with a shrug but erodes the soul, burns
      it like so much acid. We&#39;ll go around again, they say, we admit, we
      confess to not being fit for your world. The exhaustion of it. (page 102,
      The Door of No Return)

      I&#39;m coming to see how much she writes through travel, travel through
      both space and time. She was born into this, born into a story of passage,
      of departure and arrival that is simultaneous and continuous to pump her
      blood. She&#39;s conflicted but she&#39;s not, she&#39;s a witness.
      She&#39;s sharp as a razor in her observation but there is also this shrug
      in the text, &#39;the exhaustion of it&#39;, a long and deep sigh.

    <p>Hi, good morning, still showing up. Fell asleep thinking about ..</p>
    <h2 id="5">(5)</h2>

      With the turn of the year there is a clearing. I fell asleep feeling so
      old, woke up young and unexperienced. Or experienced just enough. Now
      there are chapters. The chapters contain stories and I can pin point
      &#39;I&#39;m here.&#39; There is no fog, I&#39;m here on this page and I
      lack this, this, this and have that, that, and that. I look at the setting
      sun everyday. And the I see it go up. There is a clear 12 hours of light.

      6am inside, the train is empty just prayer and breath with time the inside
      begins to resemble the road running by filled full and frantic it&#39;s
      the morning fever rush of job. I moved 3 hours up to a foggy, wet sea town
      at the cusk of a demographic explosion. babies and mothers and mothers and
      babies and boys shopping for redbull and waiting for their friends in cars
      while their friends buy weed. mostly empty. I reach to the ceiling and
      then I bend to reach under the radiators. I repeat. wave and wipe. the
      loudest machine is the car. and then I beat it sanding you down, sanding
      with satisfaction. is all touch a form of rubbing off? i rub off the train
      seat, contribute to its progressive perish. I&#39;m not longer there. I
      wiped it all away or covered up or simply said goodbye.

      Looking at you I struggle composing thoughts fit for speaking. There is
      some bulge between us but I can only look past it, I can&#39;t look under
      or from above. My words stumble upon it and I&#39;m thinking this could be
      easier on my own but then I know it&#39;s because of the bulge,
      something&#39;s troubling you. I ignore the bulge or try to at least. I
      think I know what it is, but should I poke it anyway? How to ask? On those
      moments I think myself rude. Like, at times I just want to have either
      funny conversations or work. Like I&#39;ve had enough of internal
      troubles, I am no longer.
