      couldn&#39;t not open the wine as if the liquid could transport us back.
      it does. there is gentle insertion, there is summer air and summer agendas
      and arcs of years. the wine is from 7 years ago but we drink it as if it
      was made today. nobody notices you go away. there is no promise of
      belonging here. i feel contained. it&#39;s good. it&#39;s dreamy but
      stable (solid dreaming). it seems i may need to count. i would like to
      note two currents of thought:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        the way landscape affects governance. how european comsologies have been
        shaped by apples, pears and potatos; medows, rivers, valleys and rain.
        how this delicate fabric of nature made the overlord possible,
        accessible. and how in places like mexico or australia, the land
        maintains the final verdict.
      </li>
      <li>
        is culture worth saving? something Laurence asked Anna today, about who
        finances culture and how does that contribute to the double binds of
        cultural influence. like, maybe its worth letting go and channeling this
        energy to social welfare? what financial schemes do the arts enable?
        this brings back the conversation with Y. about how the industry has
        obscured art and filled it with inflated ideas.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      else the visions for france expanded...sense of home, sense of agency,
      thinking/feeling space. good kind of slowness. attachment. laughter.
      stories floating in the air. poetic space.

      the city placed a phone in her hand. she kept looking. something heavy.
      something heavy inside. was this roundness something to worry? like a
      phone call. eternally postponed. like language. foreign in the mouth.
      muscles slow to move, making worlds anew, making her visible and not.
      maybe what she was after was indeed confrontation. this continuously
      delayed space of open conversation or speech where mouths would swallow
      each other and finally she could seize to dream.

      resisting narrative. post-Lucy, pre Cody-Rose (perhaps). short form and
      desire for play and sun-induced delay. unable to dress, able to eat a lot.
      sitting on the floor fits. matcha in cakes fits. new sunglasses and shop
      policies. can the awe for sun ever expire? could we celebrate forever?
      still not going to parties.

      this feeling mobilizes all matter you feel your fucking blood pump
      through, it&#39;s a conversation too, like the becoming of a chair and a
      pen and a tree. one could dissolve, one could, perhaps that&#39;s it a
      melting there shouldn&#39;t be a word for this
    </p>

      channel channel one erase return, be here, itchy eyes, sun beams pouring
      in, short breaths, gazes, the dance of moving to sides, i remember looking
      up last night, to the night heavy on my shoulders, pressing down, music
      pumping, trying to catch up to the blood
    </p>

      I need to walk the dog but I&#39;m feeling constipated both on the level
      of thought and action. I wanted open space and so I have it and so I&#39;m
      spinning, making turns in the air or on the floor, watching the ceiling
      and napping. I love doing nothing. The milk is really sweet. On days like
      this sociality feels absurd, or silly to the least and so I am a fish
      watching the world pass by behind a glass wall. I wonder about the
      correlation between middle class and social isolation. I liked what I read
      today in Anarchy—in a manner of speaking (109) about how middleclassness
      is not an economic category but a moral one - I enjoyed reading that
      statement, it made sense to me, comforted me perhaps. It&#39;s comforting
      to consider classes as phenomena not only tied to capital or perhaps
      pertaining to more depth than numbers. Middleclassness has a lot to do
      with entitlement, a sense of deserving, an expectation to be treated a
      certain way. The bourgeoisie can move beyond entitlement and simply top
      everything and everyone, because they (can) own everything and everyone.
      The middle class has always seemed to me terribly unattractive precisely
      because of this entitlement, which is essentially stemming from
      uncertainty, from fear of <em>the fall</em>. The upper classes can be far
      more dramatic which is entertaining, and are far more removed from society
      which makes society dream of them, the dreams fuelled by all kinds of
      media images (=mirrors). I need good sleep to even me out. The blog
      doesn&#39;t exist yet because I&#39;m having a hard time learning, and
      also letting go and also getting things done. Like I said I love doing
      nothing. The shoes arrived today but they aren&#39;t mine, they are an
      intruder to my day, a cut into a vision I&#39;ve been cultivating the last
      days. The self exists between a yes and a no. I&#39;m desiring longer
      texts for the self. Drop słów has been nourishing but also felt like
      snacking a lot (see reflection here). There&#39;s is only so much in a
      format to explore until comfort takes hold and one simply gets used to it.
      Oh how much one gets used to things. I find opposition immensely
      motivating. The whole &#39;grass is always greener on the other side&#39;
      could be tattooed on my body. Btw I found something else that could be
      tattooed today: &#39;Beneath my smooth forehead and silken hair move
      strong and manly thoughts.&#39; (from &quot;Life is Everywhere&quot;, p.13
      but actually from &quot;Mademoiselle de Maupin&quot; by Théophile Gautier)
      An obsession has taken hold. I&#39;ve been reading Lucy Ives, which means
      reading, rereading, listening to her talk, looking at her face on the
      video move as she speaks, exploring the different kinds of haircuts she
      had prior to her short cut. She&#39;s really strange and nerdy which are
      two characteristics of the kind of writing and the kind of people I enjoy.
      She begins writing on the inside, with her fingers deep inside things,
      feelings, observations. She witnesses life in a way that makes it clear
      she felt distanced from it at some point or maybe forever, it&#39;s a new
      love or a newly reworked obsession. She works a lot, that one is clear.
      There is a focus her writing that&#39;s not all that common. The
      conviction, which is so vastly different from Rennee&#39;s in method but
      still similar in affect. Joint workers of the written word.
