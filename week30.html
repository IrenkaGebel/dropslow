      like a very bad human being. like a very bad human being stumping down on
      bugs, slipping on rain, gushing out simulated streams of response being
      the reason but only in my head, such narrow sight as if glass-made she
      bends towards heat as if there was only one source of it a singularity so
      easy to get used to loving is no channel radiating spherically, circling
      around your tits gushing indeed like a very bad human being the bad could
      become a bed easily too much exists only in its centrality like move
      yourself off the point, private dance if invited you knew this long ago
      but at times it takes a Persian prince to dig it all out again an ancient
      trajectory after all lived one summer already because to multiply is so
      fucking amazing

    <p>Unhinged.</p>
    <p>
      competent person, able to monologue in an interesting manner (as in you
      don&#39;t mind). honest, harsh, excited. a piercing personality. radiant.
