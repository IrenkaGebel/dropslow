      travelling feelings, a dancing breath thick space of bodies you can&#39;t
      write with so little words and I felt uncomfortable not knowing where to
      place my hand there is so much of you but it&#39;s foreign like distant

      with something other than response.

      10pm office with orange moon. Keeping strong, a muscle worked up the rock
      the plants are tough over here tough is what i like, it turns me on to
      show a dry, stiff branch sticking out of the sun. i swam naked into the
      blackness of salt they waved from the stretch of an olive tree. pimples
      curlings mosquito bites. i&#39;m enjoying the striped shirt. i&#39;ve had
      it since forever, when i still&#39;d climbed trees.
