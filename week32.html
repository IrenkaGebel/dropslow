      -But I just want them to be happy.- People don&#39;t work this way. They
      need the contrast. They will feel happiness but it shouldn&#39;t be
      because of something you create for them. It should be borne out of the
      experience of witnessing your own happiness. And they will also experience
      hardship with you. You&#39;re in the game for all the shades dear.
      Don&#39;t control it.

      You see it become scarce yet internally it&#39;s radiant, full. you&#39;re
      waving these baskets between you and them and it seems to take from the
      writing space. are conversation and writing oppositional? does one take
      from another? in your head you&#39;re writing all the time. there was a
      story like this in Lucy - a character who lived by writing thoughts, never
      reaching the paper. what is materiality destined for when you can also
      speak with your eyes?

      you dreamed about shopping sales and moving between the space of customer
      and employee seamlessly. it&#39;s emblematic how you feel at a store irl.
      never really a client, always a servant. but also like it&#39;s okay,
      it&#39;s a plain. horizontal.

      any day and moment, tears arrive, i inhale and exhale to brush them or
      embrace. i want to repeat these loves over and over again. it&#39;s like
      imagining being read here. and you hope to be present, you tell yourself
      to not let the blush speed your words. people make beauty all the time.
      touch travels distances just like visions do. its profound to be witnessed
      like this.
