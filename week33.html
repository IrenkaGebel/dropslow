      i have pain in my right ring finger, pain in my forearms, two two red
      bites on my forehead, I have puffy eyes and an empty stomach. if you&#39;d
      ask I wouldn&#39;t know how to tell you. about myself. apart from this
      physical sensation. the only current it the circularity of orgasms, I
      would like to dissolve in sexual touches and moans. my nipples harden
      writing about this. or am i cold? i&#39;m in the most unphysical
      environment on the planet and i don&#39;t even feel like drinking coffee.

      &quot;First day of summer. I don&#39;t have to eat this dinner. The salad
      appeals to me more, the real food seems forbidding. I ate an olive,
      that&#39;s hopeful. Never eaten one before. I guess I&#39;m refusing to
      eat. All of this seems very clear, I&#39;m not at all confused about it,
      but I&#39;m wondering what&#39;s going to happen&quot; (Bernadette Mayer)

      Perhaps you&#39;re entirely redundant. ahh the ease of breath when facing
      darkness, the end would be a relief, commit to sleep as if it is the only
      way to hold yourself, it is. his taste in women is questionable. i always
      hope to get a larger pair. you&#39;re the only place i feel safe in. how
      to catch this unfolding she asked. austrian people are so polished.
      austerity. autodeduction. absolution. the equation goes that if I continue
      spending that is buying that is feeling the objects and filling my life
      it&#39;d make me heavier, more pronounced in your eyes, right?

      eating weighs in horizontally. i woke up to a pond of saliva on the green
      blanket, thick and heavy. i would still like to vacuum today. i missed the
      sign ups again and you&#39;ve landed. the couch draws in, the knee hurts.
      i guess i&#39;ll go.

      Perspective. Clarity. Decision. Intention. Being occupied in a breathless
      way, the way of the angels busy fulfilling god&#39;s wills. The first page
      of a notebook. Crossing things out of the list. How it would be nice to
      work with x. ----- Arcs? No, Dreamscapes. Only long desires, so yes, arcs,
      longs, expansive planning of love. Wants to go swimming. The lightness of
      body, it&#39;s crunchy, it&#39;s fragile. he keeps walking around and the
      muscles tenses on the left. as if we had talked, maybe it ended there, on
      the hill.

      You carry extensive sleep on your eyelids. Your body floats in the local
      swimming pool. You look at your loved ones under the beaming sun. You are
      pristine and devoured in a historical week.
