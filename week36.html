      You like receiving messages. You're writing three texts at the same time.
      Who will read you? I can't get Alice Notley out of my head. (the necessity
      to be in dialogue with established artists before you? to situate yourself
      in a discourse can be helpful for people to understand what you are aiming
      at. not everyone is from new york.) Oh you love making yourself so needed,
      so flat and necessary, my god, who taught you to weave these thin strings?
      On the other side of the bridge the water seems much more normal. You
      laugh at yourself, there is other things you're good at. People will
      forget, they will move on, there is nothing essential about it. But also,
      you care. And somehow everything lands like an offense or laziness? No,
      it's more like, confusion, and you're not confused. You know very well
      what you want and you want this, you're so close to it but it's not yours.
      What are you rewriting? (thank you for this photo of Boroughs) Are you
      further than I thought? Sadness. I need to talk to someone else anyhow.
      I'm no longer sure how much to share. I can't see that I'm important to
      you, we differ. Trained to take up space, take up more time and energy.
      Bigger and taller. More coffee, more pastries. The return is blank.
      Squishy seats, falling in and out, waking up to a black and white
      photograph of something very familiar. It's inside time over here.
      Immediately something grabs your throat. You want to wake up again. You
      realise you hate your agenda. How to use it differently? On the bus you
      wondered about the relation between limits and responsibilities. Does the
      latter imply the former? Or the other way around? Or both? Thinking feels
      hard. Clarity is gone. Sandy eyes, nap nap nap.
