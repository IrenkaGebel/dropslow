      Bo asks: It makes me wonder how you relate to characters in your writing?
      Are characters something you enjoy thinking with in your writing process?
      I'm curious, since something in me tell me you could answer this with a
      fiery 'no', but i don't know why yet. Is the idea of 'character' and
      'limit' related somehow? Thinking of being composed by the thoughts,
      words, stories of others, not 'one' character, branching as well?
