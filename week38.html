      I'm afraid the text will grow old. It's this battle between life and
      writing. Less life needs to happen for writing to happen. What do I have
      to say, whatever I have to say needs to be said every day. I keep being
      disappointed by language. You worry about the paint on the wall. I've come
      to a point when writing and reading seem so intertwined. I'm nervous
      because I've hit a dead spot and all I want is to go back to that first
      day. Thoughts were flowing so seamlessly. Maybe I'm not so much of a
      multitasker as I've assumed. There is too many question marks in the air,
      too much getting through the week. It's probably about being interrupted,
      the balance you spoke of yesterday. Maybe I should read some Jackie Wang.
      Maybe I should sleep. Best writing happens out of the dream. You wake up
      suspicious of what presents itself in front of your eyes, you wake up out
      of a memory of something opaque to others. Is art the place of suspicion
      towards the real? You're lucky to have them in your life. You're lucky to
      talk nonsense, to discuss dreams, to make things that don't matter or
      matter only to friends. Struggling to listen a classicist, you yarn for
      history but can't stand hierarchy. What will survive of us? Perhaps the
      question is wrong. How will you be read? How will your story change. It's
      an era where we're writing all the time, we have transformed into text. We
      exist on all these planes, all these interfaces are just mirrors, so often
      and so horrible reflections of greedy souls. This want, this spacious
      desire swells with time, it's already too heavy but we keep on adding to
      the pile. Sometime I place my body under this pile, I look underneath and
      see fragile faces, see grimaces and.... old stuff like the bible which is
      books which is a city which is a plant which is all just trading, moving
      things around, movement - (speaking) images - morality - divinity -
      interpretation - translation - tracing that is etymology - symbols -
      dreams (always) - memory and history but together not separately and just
      a cherry on top which is that <i>paragraphs are emotional</i>
      so paragraphs and emotions.
