      Tender. They left and you see both of them dive underwater, the water is
      thick and their mouths make big, collaborative bubbles. Their mouths grow
      larger because of the breaths and the order of days no longer matters. A
      giant sponge fills a room to the brim. Living feels like squeezing
      yourself through the tight sponge tunnels but the pace suits you. Tender
      pushes. Familiarity meets the unfamiliar and suddenly you see Dutch houses
      in Indonesia. He's wearing a young girl's dress with an open back. The
      dress is black with white rims, made of soft, sporty cotton; it ties
      around the neck and reaches just so beyond the butt cheek. It might have
      some logo in the middle of the chest but you didn't see. They warn you
      about dangerous water creatures and toxic plants that inhabit the canals.
      Air feels moist, it's too warm for the season and buildings seem
      uninhabited. People whisper to each other on the streets, making deals you
      question ever coming true. Everyone has gone mad, most of us will not show
      up. They ask you how your conversations are. You answer in paintings. What
      language could ever accurately represent the touch of a hand or colour.
      You would have never thought aesthetics would matter to you this much. Few
      years ago. You feel the fold of the year, it's like a tongue you made out
      of dough yesterday and it reminded her of lips. Two tongues make lips;
      *tormenting twists of tassels*. Time fucks you up. You return to gazing at
      the sunset. Such comfort in the image. These sentences sit at the front of
      the forehead, they are blurry, you can't reach them, like a tiny fly on
      your glasses. You make the image because you can't reach them but you want
      to stay in touch but you don't care about being connected to them. It
      gives you pleasure to try to reach them. You just want to know they are
      there. Isn't that what the image does? It is. It's enough that I've seen
      you once, you'll stay in my head forever. Sometimes it feels like your
      body is so small and the globe large and heavy, sitting there on your
      belly, pressing tenderly. Your body under the weight of the world.
      Materiality presses against you and it's pleasant. What comfort there is
      in the sense of obesity, in the lack of horizon, just endless curves to
      caress? Just fullness; like, roll me around and I'll make some imprints
      with my body and this will make a drawing in the sand and it will get
      washed away and later I'll make another one. Sometimes life is just
      eating. Putting the stranger inside of oneself until it becomes familiar
      again but once it does it flows out of your ass. This ring is spun over
      and over again. It's funny it came to submission, it's not quite that,
      it's more like collaboration or to the least, being accessible, remaining
      open. Holes it is. Being a sponge. Filling a room. Allowing you to flow
      through me. You help me make the images. You see them too.
