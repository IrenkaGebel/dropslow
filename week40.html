      Space of enunciation. At times the only way for you to forgive yourself is
      to pronounce it to them. Or a glance. Good poetry but his attention didn't
      catch your frown. To be upset at a ruined image, to want to return to the
      memory of yesterday as it was. How to undo understanding. Pause for
      business, shift of attention. We enter the fields like always from the
      west. The light is different over here. I scan the horizon and denote the
      ones behind me, surprised at their richness. There is a volume of things
      that took place and I smeared it as experience and it will continue
      looping as memory. Not much time is needed for this drowning emotion to
      take centre stage. So much laughter and so much smiling and so many words
      exchanged. Actually. It's a good thing, these are good times, it's been a
      good year. I ask everyone, or at least I try to in my head. Train ads tell
      me how to talk to my family, these seems to be quite sensitive times. Are
      they? We are all here, each one a screen. We are all here but someone is
      always absent. I fall asleep on the couch with my legs up, anxious
      thoughts pressing down on my forehead feeling the newness of corduroy,
      these amazing couches that still feel new and will continue feeling new
      for many visits to come. None of us ages here, this house maintains our
      youths and there is loads of space but somehow still the shouting comes
      through, it's faint but it reaches the kitchen where the cheesecake is
      being made. The cheesecake ignores it. We all get baked in 240. It's
      jiggly. It's like we all return to being kids, we nap and make tea and
      bake and unpack and pack the dishwasher continuously. His incapacity
      surfaces; we laugh at their generation. My news take centre stage, it's
      fun even though it's kinda strange but I enjoy the call for attention,
      only possible because you are here. They are so close now and I feel far.
      Is it strange that I like it - i like the sense of separateness, other
      stuff going on over there, there, somewhere unknown to here. Food is
      really important. Words burn in my mouth. The chemistry of baking takes
      centre stage and wins over the chemistry of emotion. Maybe all emotional
      connection that attempts to be made after trauma is only made possible
      through cake? An open mouth. Her digging on the plate and refusing dinner
      only to eat bunch of cheese and a bunch of wine but who asked. She wants
      attention but she can't be looked at. Where is the opinion? The tree got
      moved outside, it stands there in the distance; it used to take up a whole
      room. Abundance takes many shapes.
