      (Trzyma mnie świeże życie za kciuka. Czym jest orientacja w terenie
      ludzkim? Rich inner life. At the edge of fantasy, it is.) What if I'd
      undress this narrative? I look back but it's rather in front of me. Like
      in a mirror, I see myself doing these things, see myself being brash and
      loud and assertive. There is something so terrifying about choosing. I
      tend to attach to movement instead. What is so violent about a sense of
      direction? You step on grass. The water is boiling. You're so nice now,
      have you always been this way? Postponement and binge. Like, I just want
      to stand in front of you and look at you, now words, language fails us
      over and over again. I want to repeat myself endlessly. Reality can be so
      schizophrenic but it's actually real nice to see you unleashed like that.
      It is a cold depth of winter, I asked them to play but they didn't feel
      like it. What is a conversation? Is it more like a dance or playing ping
      pong? Pomidorowa fills my stomach with home and its midnight. My radiators
      are hot, my skin tightens. You told me you've got warm skin and I thought
      about your warm heart. (Sometimes it's just really hard not to think of
      yourself as a horrible person.)
